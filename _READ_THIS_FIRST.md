# IMPORTANT - Permission Issue Found!

## üîç The Problem

Your Flutter installation is owned by user **"tush"**, but you're logged in as **"mor"**.

This is preventing any Flutter commands from working.

```
Current Flutter owner: tush
Your username: mor
 Result: Permission denied
```

##  The Fix (Takes 1 Minute)

### Option 1: Automatic Fix (Easiest)

Run this command in Terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/mor/foom_app
./PERMISSION_FIX.sh
```

**Enter your password when prompted.**

This will:
1. Fix Flutter ownership
2. Clean the project
3. Get dependencies  
4. Build your APK

‚è±Ô∏è Total time: 5-10 minutes

---

### Option 2: Manual Fix

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# Step 1: Fix Flutter ownership (requires password)
sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local/share/flutter

# Step 2: Build
cd /Users/mor/foom_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

---

##  What Happens After

Once permissions are fixed:
- Flutter will work normally
- Dependencies will install
- APK will build successfully
- You'll never need to do this again

Your APK will be at:
```
/Users/mor/foom_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

---

## Alternative: Ask User "tush"

If you share this Mac with user "tush", they can either:

1. **Give you access:**
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R mor:admin /usr/local/share/flutter
   ```

2. **Or build for you:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mor/foom_app
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

---

##  After Building

Install on your phone:
```bash
flutter install
```

Or copy the APK file from:
```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

---

##  Your App is Ready!

Everything is coded and ready to go. Just need this one permission fix!

**Run:** `./PERMISSION_FIX.sh`

 That's it!

---

##  Why This Happened

Flutter was probably installed by user "tush" who has admin rights. When you try to use it as "mor", you don't have permission to write to Flutter's cache directory.

This is a common issue on shared Macs. The fix is safe and only changes Flutter's ownership.
