## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Test with Real Data**
   - Use the app for a full day to see real usage stats
   - Grant all permissions to test full functionality

2. **Backend Setup**
   - You'll need a backend API for M-Pesa payments
   - Consider using Firebase Cloud Functions
   - See `lib/services/payment_service.dart` for API specs

3. **Customization**
   - Update colors in `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`
   - Change app name in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
   - Update icon in `android/app/src/main/res/`

4. **Performance**
   - First build takes 5-10 minutes
   - Subsequent builds are faster
   - Use `flutter build apk --split-per-abi` for smaller APKs

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **App Blocking** - Requires Accessibility Service (user must enable manually)
2. **M-Pesa Payments** - Requires backend API (not included)
3. **MMF Integration** - Requires partnership with fund providers
4. **iOS Version** - Not yet implemented (Android only)
