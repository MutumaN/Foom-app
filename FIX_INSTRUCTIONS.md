# ðŸ”§ Fix Flutter & Build APK

## The Problem

Your Flutter installation has a permission issue with its cache directory. This prevents any Flutter commands from running.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Run the Fix Script (Easiest)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/mor/foom_app
sudo ./fix_flutter_and_build.sh
```

Enter your Mac password when prompted. This script will:
1. Fix Flutter permissions
2. Clean the project
3. Get dependencies
4. Build your APK

**That's it!** Your APK will be ready in 5-10 minutes.

### Option 2: Manual Fix

If you prefer to do it manually:

#### Step 1: Fix Flutter Permissions
```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/share/flutter
```

#### Step 2: Build the APK
```bash
cd /Users/mor/foom_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

---

## After Building

Your APK will be at:
```
/Users/mor/foom_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Install on Your Phone

**Via Flutter:**
```bash
flutter install
```

**Via ADB:**
```bash
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

**Manual:**
1. Copy the APK file to your phone
2. Open it and install
3. You may need to allow "Install from Unknown Sources"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors
Make sure you're using `sudo`:
```bash
sudo ./fix_flutter_and_build.sh
```

### "Flutter not found"
Check Flutter installation:
```bash
which flutter
flutter doctor -v
```

### Build takes too long
First build can take 10-15 minutes. This is normal.

### Still having issues?

Try this complete reset:
```bash
# Fix all Flutter permissions
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/share/flutter

# Go to project
cd /Users/mor/foom_app

# Complete clean
flutter clean
rm -rf build/
rm -rf .dart_tool/

# Rebuild
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

## What's Next?

Once your APK is built:

1. âœ… Install on your phone
2. âœ… Create an account (email or Google)
3. âœ… Grant Usage Access permission
4. âœ… Start using the app!
5. âœ… Check back tomorrow to see your first tokens!

---

## Expected Build Output

You should see:
```
âœ“ Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk (45.2MB)
```

File size will be around 40-60 MB.
